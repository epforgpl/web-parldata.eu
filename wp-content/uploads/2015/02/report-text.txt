Availability of information on activities of national parliament is a necessary condition for strong and stable democracy. Parliaments and parliamentary chambers vary significantly in an extent to which they publish various data about their activities and in ways how they provide them to the public. The ways of publishing parliamentary data are very important because they determine how easy it is to search, understand, obtain and re-use this data.


This publication surveys and evaluates availability and openness of a large number of key parliamentary data types in 12 parliamentary chambers in the Visegrad and Western Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Czech Republic, Hungary, Kosovo, Montenegro, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia). Its aim is to help increase availability, quality and re-usability of parliamentary information by comparing the surveyed parliamentary chambers, identifying strengths and weaknesses and recommending specific strategies to mitigate them.


KEY FINDINGS


        The parliamentary chambers in the Visegrad countries generally exhibit a higher level of parliamentary data availability and openness that parliamentary chambers in the Western Balkans countries. There are, however, positive examples of parliamentary transparency in the Western Balkans, as well as significant shortcomings in the Visegrad countries.
        The most open parliamentary chambers are the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic, the Polish Sejm and the Polish Senate. The least open chambers are the parliament of Kosovo and the House of People of Bosnia and Hercegovina.
        Data related to plenary sessions is more available and open than data related to committee sessions in every parliamentary chamber surveyed.
        Many documents are published in PDF and textual formats that obstruct machine readability and thus re-usability of the data.


RECOMMENDATIONS


        In many parliamentary chambers, information on members of parliaments’ (MPs) professional background, formal education and other positions that they hold in the public sector is incomplete and incomparable. This would be effectively and easily mitigated if the MPs were asked to fill in a standardized questionnaire.
        Many parliamentary chambers publish MPs’ declaration of assets. However, they are published as PDF files and sometimes even as scans of hand written documents. The quality of asset declarations would increase if the declarations were released in machine readable formats (e.g. as tabular data).
        Word-by-word transcripts of parliamentary sessions are often published in PDF files that do not identify individual speakers in a standardized was. It is highly recommended to publish transcripts as HTML, XML or JSON files since it would significantly increase re-usability of the data.
        In many parliamentary chambers, committee sessions are only reported about in a form of short written summaries. It is recommended to produce and publish either audio or video recordings or word-by-word transcripts of committee sessions.
        Many parliaments publish results of only selected votes taken during plenary sessions (e.g. only of final votes on legislation). It is advised that results of all votes are published by default (i.e. unless secret voting is explicitly required).
        Results of votes taken during committee sessions are not recorded by names of individual MPs in any of the surveyed countries. It is recommended to record and publish results of at least the most important votes taken during committee sessions (e.g. final votes on legislation).
        Most parliaments in the region produce audio or video recordings of plenary sessions. It is recommended to provide these recordings for download and to include timestamps that mark individual speakers.
        Most legal documents published on the official parliamentary websites (e.g. text of bill proposals, amendments, committee resolutions, approved legislation) are published as PDF and DOC files. It is recommended to publish legal documents (proposals, amendments, law) in structured formats (HTML, XLM etc.) that improve their machine readability.
        It is strongly recommended to provide raw parliamentary data in machine readable formats that enables remote access and bulk download either via an API or bulk downloads.


POSITIVE EXAMPLES


        In the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, the official parliamentary websites publish identity and contact information of MPs’ personal staff.
        In Slovakia, salaries of MPs’ personal staff are disclosed.
        The parliaments of the Czech Republic, Montenegro, Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia publish MPs’ declarations of assets.
        The Polish Sejm is the only parliamentary chamber in the region that publishes information about MPs’ travel expenses. Although this information is incomplete it is definitely a step in the right direction.
        The Polish Senate is the only parliamentary chamber in the region that publishes regular reports about interactions of MPs’ and lobbyists including their names and professional affiliations
        In the parliaments of Albania and Hungary and in the Polish Sejm, word-by-word transcripts of committee sessions are produced and published on the official parliamentary website.
        The parliaments of the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia publish results of every vote taken during plenary sessions by names of individual MPs by default.
        In Bosnia and Hercegovina, audio recordings of plenary session are published in files that are also available for download.
        In Poland, video recordings of plenary session include timestamps that identify individual speakers.
        The official parliamentary website of the Czech Chamber of Deputies contains a graphical overview of each bill’s flow in the legislative process.
        The Czech Chamber of Deputies provides regularly updated raw dumps of the parliamentary database.

Gatishmëria e informacionit mbi aktivitetet e parlamenteve kombëtare është një kusht i domosdoshëm për një demokraci të fortë dhe të qëndrueshme. Parlamentet dhe dhomat parlamentare të vendeve të ndryshme ndryshojnë në mënyrë të qenësishme prej njëri-tjetrit si përsa i përket publikimit të të dhënave mbi aktivitetin e vet ashtu edhe përsa i përket mënyrës se si këto të dhëna i ofrohen publikut. Nga ana tjetër, mënyra me të cilën këto të dhëna bëhen publike është shumë e rëndësishme pasi përcakton lehtësinë me të cilën ato mund të gjenden, kuptohen apo ripërdoren.


Ky raport bën publike rezultatet e një studimi me anë të të cilit janë vlerësuar gatishmëria dhe transparenca e një numri të konsiderueshëm të dhënash kyçe parlamentare në 12 dhoma parlamentare në vendet e Vishegradit dhe Ballkanit Perëndimor (Shqipëri, Bosnje-Hercegovinë, Republika Çeke, Hungari, Kosovë, Mali i Zi, Poloni, Serbi dhe Sllovaki). Qëllimi i projektit në kuadër të cilit studimi u realizua është të rritë gatishmërinë, cilësinë dhe ripërdorimin e informacionit nga parlamentet duke krahasuar dhomat parlamentare nën hulumtim, identifikuar pikat e forta dhe të dobëta dhe rekomanduar strategji specifike për të zbutur problemet e vërejtura. 


GJETJET KYÇ


        Dhomat parlamentare në vendet e Vishegradit përgjithësisht kanë një nivel më të lartë të gatishmërisë së të dhënave parlamentare dhe transparencës sesa dhomat parlamentare të vendeve të Ballkanit Perëndimor. Megjithatë, shembuj pozitivë të transparencës parlamentare mund të gjenden në Ballkanin Perëndimor, si dhe problematika në vendet e Vishegradit. 
        Dhomat parlamentare me nivelin më të lartë të transparencës janë Dhoma e Deputetëve e Republikës Çeke, Sejm-i polak dhe Senati polak. Dhomat me nivelin më të ulët të transparencës janë Parlamenti i Kosovës dhe Dhoma e Popullit e Bosnje-Hercegovinës. 
        Të dhënat mbi seancat plenare janë më të gatshme dhe më transparente sesa të dhënat mbi mbledhjet e komisioneve parlamentare në çdo dhomë parlamentare nën hulumtim.
        Shumë dokumente gjenden të publikuara në formatin PDF apo të tjera formate teksti të cilat pengojnë lexueshmërinë nga makinat dhe, si rrjedhim, ripërdorimin e të dhënave. 


REKOMANDIME


        Në shumë prej dhomave parlamentare informacioni mbi anëtarët e parlamentit, si profesionin e mëparshëm, edukimin formal apo të tjera pozicione që ata mbajnë në sektorin publik është i paplotë dhe i pakrahasueshëm. Kjo mund të përmirësohej ndjeshëm nëse anëtarëve të parlamentit do tu kërkohej të mbushin një pyetësor të standardizuar. 
        Shumë dhoma parlamentare publikojnë deklaratat e pasurive të anëtarëve të parlamentit. Megjithatë, ky informacion publikohet në formën e dokumenteve në formatin PDF bile në disa raste janë dokumente të shkruara me dorë dhe të skanuara. Cilësia e deklaratave të pasurive do të përmirësohej ndjeshëm nëse këto të fundit do të publikoheshin në format të tillë që të mundësonte leximin e tyre prej kompjuterave (p.sh. në formë tabelore). 
        Transkriptet fjalë për fjalë të sesioneve parlamentare shpesh publikohen si dokumente në format PDF dhe mungon identifikimi i folësve individualë në format të standardizuar. Do të ishte e rekomandueshme që transkriptet të publikohen në formatet HTML, XML apo JSON çka do të përmirësonte ndjeshëm ripërdorimin e të dhënave. 
        Në shumë dhoma parlamentare mbledhjet e komisioneve parlamentare raportohen vetëm në formën e përmbledhjeve të shkurtra. Rekomandohet që të prodhohen dhe publikohen regjistrime audio ose video ose transkprite fjalë për fjalë të mbledhjeve të komisioneve. 
        Shumë dhoma parlamentare publikojnë rezultatet e votimit vetëm për disa prej votimeve të mbajtura gjatë sesioneve plenare (p.sh. vetëm rezultate mbi ligjet e aprovuara). Këshillohet që të bëhen publike rezultatet e të gjitha votimeve të mbajtura (përveç rasteve në të cilat votimi i fshehtë kërkohet specifikisht).
        Rezultatet e votimeve në mbledhjet e komisioneve parlamentare nuk regjistrohen në emër të deputetëve në asnjë prej vendeve nën hulumtim. Rekomandohet që të bëhen publike së paku votimet më të rëndësishme të mbajtura gjatë komisioneve parlamentare (p.sh. votimet finale mbi ligjet).
        Shumë prej parlamenteve të rajonit prodhojnë regjistrime audio apo video të sesioneve plenare. Rekomandohet që këto regjistrime të jenë të mundura të shkarkohen dhe të vendosen shenja të cilat të bëjnë të mundur identifikimin e fillimit të fjalimit të folësve individualë.  
        Shumë dokumente ligjore të publikuar në faqet zyrtare të parlamenteve (p.sh. tekstet e propozimeve legjislative, amendamenteve, rezolutave të komisioneve, ligjeve të aprovuara) publikohen në formatin PDF ose DOC. Rekomandohet që dokumentet ligjore (propozimet, amdendimet, ligjet) të publikohen në format të strukturuar (HTML, XLM etj.) çka do të përmirësonte mundësinë për tu lexuar nga kompjuterat. 
        Rekomandohet fort që të dhënat parlamentare bruto të bëhen të aksesueshme në formate që të mundësojnë lexueshmërinë nga kompjuterat në mënyrë që të mundësohet aksesismi i tyre në distancë apo shkarkimi në grupe të mëdha. 


SHEMBUJ POZITIVË:


        Në Republikën Çeke, Poloni dhe Sllovaki faqet zyrtare të parlamenteve publikojnë identitetin dhe informacionin e kontaktit për stafin personal të anëtarëve të parlamentit. 
        Në Sllovaki janë publike rrogat e stafit personal të anëtarëve të parlamentit. 
        Parlamentet e Republikës Çeke, Malit të Zi, Polonisë, Hungarisë dhe Sllovakisë publikojnë deklaratat e pasurive të anëtarëve të parlamentit. 
        Sejm-i Polak është e vetmja dhomë parlamentare në rajon që publikon të dhëna mbi shpenzimet e udhëtimit të anëtarëve të parlamentit. 
        Senati i Polonisë është e vetmja dhomë parlamentare në rajon që publikon raporte të rregullta mbi ndërveprimin e anëtarëve të Senatit me lobistët, përfshi emrin dhe afilimin personal të këtyre lobistëve.   
        Në Kuvendin e Shqipërisë, Parlamentin e Hungarisë dhe Sejm-in e Polonisë mund të gjenden transkriptet fjalë për fjalë të mbledhjeve të komisioneve parlamentare në faqet zyrtare. 
        Parlamenti i Republikës Çeke, Polonisë, Hungari dhe Sllovakisë publikojnë rezultatet e çdo votimi të ndërmarrë gjatë sesioneve plenare sipas emrave të deputetëve individualë. 
        Në Bosnje-Hercegovinë, regjistrimet audio të sesioneve plenare publikohen në format që është i mundur të shkarkohet.  
        Në Poloni regjistrimet video të sesioneve plenare kanë shënjues kohorë që mundësojnë identifikimin e folësve individualë. 
        Faqja zyrtare e Dhomës së Deputetëve të Çekisë përmban një pamje grafike të rrugës që ka ndjekur secili ligj përgjatë procesit legjislativ. 
        Dhoma e Deputetëve të Çekisë ofron mundësinë për të shkarkuar të dhënat nga baza e të dhënave në grupe të mëdha duke i përditësuar ato rregullisht.

Dostupnost informacija o aktivnostima državnih parlamenata je važan uslov za jaku i stabilnu demokratiju. Parlamenti i domovi parlamenata u različitoj mjeri objavljuju različite podatke o svojim aktivnostima, a razlikuju se i po načinu na koji ove podatke prezentuju javnosti. Načini objavljivanja parlamentarnih podataka su jako važni, budući da određuju koliko je jednostavno pretraživanje, razumijevanje, dobijanje i korištenje ovih podataka. 


U ovoj publikaciji se postmatra i evaluira dostupnost i otvorenost velikog broja ključnih parlamentarnih tipova podataka u 12 domova parlamenata u zemljama Višegrada i Zapadnog Balkana (Albanija, Bosna i Hercegovina, Češka Republika, Mađarska, Kosovo, Crna Goda, Poljska, Srbija, Slovačka). Cilj ove publikacije je da pomogne u povećanju dostupnosti, kvaliteta i ponovne upotrebljivosti parlamentarnih informacija upoređujući posmatrane domove parlamenata, identifikujući dobre i lose strane, te preporučujući specifične strategije koje će pomoći u prevazilaženju prepreka.


KLJUČNA SAZNANJA:


        Domovi parlamenata u zemljama Višegrada generalno pokazuju viši nivo dostupnosti parlamentarnih podataka I otvorenosti od zemalja Zapadnog Balkana. Međutim, postoje i pozitivni primjeri transparentnosti parlamenata među zemljama Zapadnog Balkana, kao i značajne mane među zemljama Višegrada. 
        Najotvoreniji domovi parlamenata su Zastupnički dom Parlamenta Češke Republike, Zastupnički dom Parlamenta Poljske i Senat Poljske. Najmanje otvoreni domovi parlamenata su Parlament Kosova i Dom naroda Parlamenta Bosne i Hercegovine.
        Podaci vezani za sjednice parlamenata su dostupniji i otvoreniji od podataka koji su vezani za sjednice komisija u svim posmatranim domovima.
        Mnogi dokumenti se objavljuju u PDF i tekstualnim formatima koji smanjuju mašinsku čitljivost dokumenata, te konsekventno ponovnu upotrebljivost 
PREPORUKE:


        U mnogim domovima, informacije o zastupnicima/delegatima kao što su njihova profesionalna pozadina, formalno obrazovanje ili druge pozicije koje obnašaju u javnom sektoru su nekompletne i neuporedive. Ova situacija bi se lako mogla izbjeći i unaprijediti okoliko bi zastupnici/delegate ispunili standardizovani upitnik.
        Mnogi domovi objavljuju imovinske kartone zastupnika/delagata. Međutim, imovinski kartoni se objavljuju kao PDF dokumenti, a ponekada čak i kao skenovi ručno pisanih dokumenata. Kvalitet imovinskih kartona bi se značajno povećao ukoliko bi se kartoni objavljivali u formatima pogodnim za mašinsko čitanje (npr. tabelarni prikaz podataka).
        Stenogrami sjednca se često objavljuju u PDF dokumentima u kojima se ne naznačavaju govornici u standardizovanom obliku. Preporučuje se da se stenogrami objavljuju u HTML, XML ili JSON format, budući da bi takvo objavljivanje značajno povećalo mogućnost ponovnog korištenja podataka. 
        U mnogim domovima se o sjednicama komisija izvještava u obliku kratih pisanih sažetaka istih. Preporučuje se da se informacije sa sjednica komisija objavljuju u vidu audio/video snimaka ili stanograma.
        U mnogim domovima se objavljuju samo određeni rezultati glasanja (npr. samo finalni rezultati glasanja o zakonima). Preporučuje se da se rezultati svih glasanja objavljuju po automatizmu (npr. osim ako je tajno glasanje eksplicitno traženo). 
        Reziltati glasanja na sjednicama komisija po imenima članova nisu dostupni ni u jednoj od posmatranih zemalja.  Preporučuje se da se bilježe i objavljuju rezultati barem najvažnijih glasanja na sjednicama komisija (npr. finalnog glasanja na zakone). 
        Većina parlamenata u region imaju audio i video zapise sjednica. Preporučuje se da se omogući preuzimanje ovih zapisa, te da se uključe vremenske oznake govora pojedinačnih govornika. 
        Većina zakonskih dokumenata (npr. tekstovi prijedloga zakona, amandmani, odluke komisija, usvojeni zakoni), se objavljuje u formi PDF i DOC dokumenata. Preporučuje se da se zakonski dokumenti (nacrti, prijedlozi, amandmani, zakoni) objavljuju u strukturiranim formatima (XTML XML itd.) kako bi se poboljšala mašinska čitljivost dokumenata. 
        Snažno se preporučuje da parlamenti omoguće daljinski pristup ‘sirovim podacima’ u mašinsko čitljivim formatima i da se omogući ‘bulk download’ tih podataka. 


POZITIVNI PRIMJERI:


        U Češkoj Republici, Poljskoj i Slovačkoj zvanični sajtovi parlamenata objavljuju kontakt informacije i identitet ličnog osoblja zastupnika/delegata. 
        U Slovačkoj su dostupne informacije o primanjima ličnog osoblja zastupnika/delegata. 
        Parlamenti Češke Republike, Crne Gore, Poljske, Mađarske i Slovačke objavljuju imovinske kartone zastupnika/delegata. 
        Zastupnički dom Parlamenta Poljske je jedini dom parlamenta koji objavljuje informacije o putnim troškovima zastupnika. 
        Senat Poljske je jedini dom parlamenta u region koji redovno objavljuje izbještaje o interakciji članova ovog doma sa lobistima, uključujući njihova imena i lične veze. 
        U parlamentima u Albaniji i Mađarskoj, te u Zastupničkom domu Parlamenta Poljske, stenogrami sjednica se objavljuju na zvaničnim sajtovima parlamenata.
        Parlamenti Češke Republike, Poljske, Madžarske i Slovačke objavljuju rezultate svakog glasanja tokom sjednice, po imenima zastupnika/delegate. 
        U Bosni i Hercegovini, audio snimci sjednica se objavljuju na sajtovima parlamenata i dostupni su za download
        U Poljskoj, video snimci sjednica imaju vremenske oznake koje označavaju govore različitih zastupnika. 
        Zvanični sajt Zastupničkog doma Parlamenta Češke Republike ima grafički prikaz puta svakog zakona u procedure.
        Zastupnički dom Parlamenta Češke Republike redovno objavljuje ‘sirove baze parlamentarnih podataka’.
  
CZECH


Dostupnost informací týkající se aktivit národních parlamentů je nezbytná podmínka pro silnou a stabilní demokracii. Parlamenty a parlamentní komory se výrazně liší v míře, v jaké publikují různá data týkající se jejich aktivity a ve způsobu, jakým je poskytují veřejnosti. Způsoby, jakým jsou data týkající se činnosti parlamentů publikována, jsou velmi podstatné, protože předurčují, jak jednoduché je vyhledávat, pochopit, získat a znovu využít zmíněná data.


Tato publikace zkoumá a hodnotí dostupnost a otevřenost velkého počtu parlamentních dat v 12 parlamentních komorách v zemích Visegrádu a Západního Balkánu (Albánie, Bosna a Hercegovina, Česká republika, Maďarsko, Kosovo, Černá Hora, Polsko, Srbsko, Slovensko). Jejím cílem je pomoci zvýšit dostupnost, kvalitu a znovu-využitelnost parlamentních informací tím, že porovnává zkoumané parlamentní komory, identifikuje silné a slabé stránky a doporučuje specifické strategie k jejich překonání.


KLÍČOVÁ ZJIŠTĚNÍ:


        Parlamentní komory Visegrádských zemí obecně vykazují vyšší úroveň dostupnosti parlamentních dat a otevřenosti než parlamentní komory zemí Západního Balkánu. I tak v Západním Balkánu nalezneme pozitivní příklady parlamentní transparentnosti a stejně tak signifikantní nedostatky ve Visegradských zemích.
        Nejvíce otevřené komory jsou Poslanecká sněmovna Parlamentu České republiky, polský Sejm a polský Senát. Nejméně otevřené komory jsou parlament Kosova a Sněmovna lidu Bosny a Hercegoviny.
        Data vztahující se k plenárním zasedáním jsou více dostupná než data vztahující se k zasedáním komisí a to ve všech zkoumaných parlamentech.
        Mnoho dokumentů bylo publikovaných jako PDF a v textových formátech, které překáží strojové čitelnosti a tím také znovu-využitelnosti dat.


DOPORUČENÍ:


        V mnoha parlamentních komorách jsou informace týkající se členů komory, jejich profesionálního pozadí, vzdělání a dalších pozic, které zastávají ve veřejném sektoru, nekompletní a neporovnatelné. Toto je možné lehce odstranit, pakliže by členové komor vyplňovali standardizovaný dotazník.
        Mnoho parlamentních komor publikuje majetková přiznání členů komory. Nicméně ta jsou publikována jako PDF soubory a někdy dokonce jako scany ručně psaných dokumentů. Kvalita majetkových přiznání by se zvýšila, pokud by byla přiznání publikovaná ve strojově čitelné podobě (např. jako tabulková data).
        Stenozáznamy parlamentních zasedání jsou často publikována v PDF souborech, které neidentifikují jednotlivé řečníky ve standardizované podobě. Je vysoce doporučováno publikovat transkripty jako HTML, XML nebo JSON soubory, protože by to výrazně zvýšilo znovu-využitelnost dat.
        V mnoha parlamentních komorách je o zasedání komisí reportováno pouze ve formě krátkého psaného shrnutí. Je doporučováno produkovat a publikovat buď zvukový nebo video záznam nebo doslovný přepis zasedání komisí.
        Mnoho parlamentů publikuje výsledky pouze vybraných hlasování probíhajících během plenárního zasedání (např. pouze finální hlasování týkající se legislativy). Je doporučováno, aby byla standardně publikována všechna hlasování (mimo těch hlasování, u kterých je explicitně vyžadováno tajné hlasování).
        Výsledky hlasování zasedání komisí nejsou zaznamenány po jménech jednotlivých poslanců v žádné ze zkoumaných zemích. Je doporučeno zaznamenávat a publikovat výsledky minimálně těch nejvíce významných hlasování komisí (např. finální hlasování o legislativě).
        Většina parlamentů regionu produkuje audio a video záznamy plenárního zasedání.  Je doporučeno poskytovat tyto záznamy pro stáhnutí a opatřit je časovou značkou, která označí jednotlivé řečníky.
        Většina dokumentů právní povahy, které jsou publikovány na oficiálních parlamentních webových stránkách (např. texty návrhů zákonů, dodatky, rozhodnutí komisí, schválená legislativa), jsou publikovány ve formě PDF nebo DOC souborů. Doporučuje se publikovat tyto dokumentu (návrhy, dodatky, zákony) ve strukturovaném formátu (HTML, XML atd.), což zvýší strojovou čitelnost dat.
        Je silně doporučeno poskytnout surová parlamentní data ve strojově čitelném formátu, který umožňuje vzdálených přístup a stahování dat ve velkém objemu buď skrze API, nebo velkoobjemovému stahování.


 
POZITIVNÍ PŘÍKLADY:


        V České republice, Polsku a Slovensku publikují oficiální parlamentní webové stránky identitu a kontaktní informace asistentů poslanců.
        Ve Slovensku je přiložen i plat poslanců a asistentů.
        Parlamenty České republiky, Černé Hory, Polska, Maďarska a Slovenska publikují majetková přiznání poslanců.
        Polský Sejm je jediná parlamentní komora v regionu, která publikuje informace o cestovních výdajích poslanců. Ačkoli je tato informace neúplná, je to určitě krok správným směrem.
        Polský Senát je jediná parlamentní komora v regionu, která publikuje pravidelné reporty týkající se interakce poslanců a lobbistů, včetně jejich jmen a profesních vztahů.
        V parlamentech Albánie, Maďarska a Polského Sejmu jsou publikovány doslovné přepisy zasedání komisí, které jsou dostupné na oficiálních parlamentních webových stránkách.
        Parlamenty České republiky, Polska, Maďarska a Slovenska vždy publikují výsledky každého hlasování plenárního zasedání po jménech jednotlivých poslanců.
        V Bosně a Hercegovině jsou publikovány audio záznamy plenárních zasedáních v souborech dostupných ke stažení.
        V Polsku mají videozáznamy plenárního zasedání časovou značku, která identifikuje jednotlivé mluvčí.
        Oficiální parlamentní webové stránky české Poslanecké sněmovny obsahují grafické znázornění legislativního procesu každého jednotlivého návrhu.
        Česká Poslanecká sněmovna poskytuje pravidelně aktualizované raw dumps parlamentní databáze.

Egy erős és stabil demokráciának elengedhetetlen kelléke, hogy a nemzeti parlament működésével kapcsolatos információk minden állampolgár számára hozzáférhetőek legyenek. Nagyon változó, hogy az egyes parlamentek és parlamenti kamarák milyen adatokat tesznek közzé, és azok milyen formában érhetőek el a nyilvánosság számára. A parlamenti adatok nyilvánosságra hozatalának módja fontos kérdés, mivel ez határozza meg, hogy a felhasználók számára mennyire egyszerű az adatok letöltése, értelmezése, valamint az adatok közötti keresés és az adatok újrahasznosítása. 


Ez a kutatás a visegrádi és nyugat-balkáni országok (Albánia, Bosznia-Hercegovina, Csehország, Koszovó, Lengyelország, Magyarország, Montenegró, Szerbia, Szlovákia) 12 parlamenti kamaráját vizsgálja általunk különösen fontosnak tartott adatok elérhetősége és hozzáférhetősége szempontjából. A munka célja, hogy a parlamenti kamarák összehasonlításával, a jó- és rosszgyakorlatok azonosításával, továbbá stratégiai javaslatokkal hozzájáruljon a parlamenti adatok könnyebb elérhetőségéhez, jobb minőségéhez és az egyszerűbb újrahasznosíthatósághoz. 


FŐ MEGÁLLAPÍTÁSOK:


        Általánosan elmondható, hogy a  visegrádi országok parlamenti kamarái nagyobb mennyiségű adatot tesznek elérhetővé, mint a nyugat-balkániak, azonban a Nyugat-Balkánon is találunk jó példákat a parlamenti átláthatóságra csakúgy, mint súlyos hiányosságokat a visegrádi országok esetében.
        A legnyíltabban működő parlamenti kamara a cseh Képviselőház (alsóház), valamint a lengyel alsó- és felsőház, a Szejm és a Szenátus. A legkevésbé nyílt parlamenti kamarák a koszovói parlament és a bosznia-hercegovinai Nemzetek Háza.
        Az összes vizsgált parlament esetében igaz, hogy a plenáris ülésekkel kapcsolatos adatok könnyebben elérhetőek és nyíltabbak, mint a bizottsági ülésekre vonatkozóak.
        Sok dokumentumot PDF és egyéb olyan szöveges formátumban tesznek közzé, amelyek a gépi olvashatóságot, így pedig az újrahasznosíthatóságot is megnehezítik.


JAVASLATOK:


        Számos parlamenti kamara esetében a képviselők szakmai életrajza, iskolai végzettsége, illetve a közszférában betöltött más pozícióik hiányosan szerepelnek és nem összehasonlíthatóak. Erre hatékonyan és egyszerű megoldás volna, ha minden képviselőnek ugyanazt a standardizált kérdőívet kellene kitöltenie.
        Jellemzően közlik a parlamenti honlapok a képviselők vagyonnyilatkozatát is, azonban ezt rendszerint PDF formátumú fájlokban hozzák nyilvánosságra, sőt, néhány esetben kézzel írott dokumentumok szkennelt verzióját teszik elérhetővé. A vagyonnyilatkozati közzététel minősége javulna, ha gépi olvashatóságot lehetővé tevő (pl. táblázatos) formátumban közölnék őket.
        A parlamenti ülések szó szerinti jegyzőkönyveit is gyakran PDF formátumban hozzák nyilvánosságra, ahol az egyes felszólalókat nem jelölik standardizált módon. Erősen ajánlott a HTML, XML vagy JSON formátumok használata az adatok publikálásánál, mivel ez jelentősen megnövelné az adatok újrahasználhatóságát.
        Sok parlamenti kamara esetében a bizottsági ülésekről csak rövid írásos összefoglaló készül. Ajánlott lenne az ülésekről videó- vagy hangfelvételeket, illetve szó szerinti jegyzőkönyvet közölni. 
        A vizsgált parlamentek közül sok helyütt csak bizonyos plenáris szavazások (pl. csak egy javaslat végszavazásának) eredményeit teszik közzé. Javasolt, hogy minden szavazás eredménye automatikusan kerüljön fel a honlapra (itt a titkos szavazások képezhetnek egyedül kivételt).
        A bizottsági szavazások eredményeit egy vizsgált országban sem rögzítik név szerint, képviselőnként. Javasoljuk, hogy legalább a legfontosabb bizottsági szavazások (pl. végszavazások) esetében rögzítsék és hozzák nyilvánosságra  az eredményeket.
        A régió legtöbb parlamentjében készül videó- vagy hangfelvétel a plenáris ülésekről. Javasolt, hogy ezek a felvételek letölthetőek legyenek és időbélyegekkel jelöljék az egyes felszólalókat.
        A hivatalos parlamenti honlapokon közölt törvénykezési dokumentumok (pl. törvényjavaslatok szövege, módosító indítványok, bizottsági határozatok, elfogadott törvények) többségét PDF vagy DOC formátumban teszik közzé. Javasoljuk, hogy a törvénykezési dokumentumok (törvény- és módosító javaslatok, törvényszövegek) strukturált formátumban (HTML, XML) kerüljenek fel a honlapra, javítva gépi olvashatóságukat.
        Erősen ajánlott, hogy a nyers parlamenti adatok elérhetőek legyenek géppel olvasható formátumban, ami lehetővé teszi az interneten keresztüli hozzáférést, és nagy mennyiségű adat letöltését egyben vagy API-n keresztül. 


POZITÍV PÉLDÁK:


        Csehországban, Lengyelországban és Szlovákiában a hivatalos parlamenti honlapon megtalálható a képviselők munkatársainak neve és elérhetősége is.
        Szlovákiában közzéteszik a képviselők fizetését és hogy kikből áll személyes stábjuk.
        A cseh, a montenegrói, a lengyel, magyarország és a szlovák parlament közzéteszi a képviselők vagyonnyilatkozatát.
        A lengyel szejm az egyetlen parlamenti kamara a régióban, amely közöl adatokat a képviselők utazási költségeiről.
        A lengyel szenátus az egyetlen parlamenti kamara a régióban, amely rendszeres jelentéseket közöl a képviselők és lobbisták találkozóiról, beleértve utóbbiak nevét és azt, hogy kit képviselnek.
        Az albán és a magyar parlamentben, valamint a lengyel szejmben a bizottsági ülésekről szó szerinti jegyzőkönyv készül, amelyek elérhetőek a parlament hivatalos honlapján.
        A cseh, a lengyel, a magyar és a szlovák parlament automatikusan nyilvánosságra hozza a plenáris ülés minden szavazásának eredményét a képviselők nevével együtt.
        Bosznia-Hercegovinában a plenáris ülésekről készült hangfelvételek letölthetőek a honlapról.
        Lengyelországban a plenáris ülésekről készült videó-felvételeken külön időbélyegekkel jelölik az egyes felszólalások kezdetét.
        A cseh képviselőház hivatalos parlamenti honlapján grafikus ábrán tekinthető meg, hogy az egyes törvényjavaslatok a törvénykezési folyamat mely szakaszában vannak.
        A cseh képviselőház rendszeresen frissíti és  közzéteszi a parlamenti adatok nyers adatbázisát.

Dostępność informacji o działalności parlamentu narodowego jest warunkiem koniecznym dla silnej i stabilnej demokracji. Zakres publikowania danych o sposobie działalności różnych izb parlamentarnych i sposób ich udostępnienia znacznie się różnią w różnych państwach. Sposoby publikowania danych parlamentarnych są niezwykle istotne, ponieważ określają, jak łatwo jest je odszukać, zrozumieć, pozyskać oraz przetworzyć.


Niniejsza publikacja analizuje i podsumowuje dostępność i otwartość wielu typów danych parlamentarnych w 12 izbach parlamentarnych Grupy Wyszehradzkiej i krajów Bałkanów Zachodnich (Albania, Bośnia i Hercegowina, Czechy, Węgry, Kosowo, Czarnogóra, Polska, Serbia, Słowacja). Jej celem jest pomoc w zwiększeniu dostępności, jakości i możliwości przetwarzania informacji parlamentarnych poprzez porównanie analizowanych izb parlamentarnych, identyfikację mocnych i słabych stron oraz rekomendowanie konkretnych strategii ich łagodzenia.


NAJWAŻNIEJSZE USTALENIA:


        Izby parlamentarne w krajach Grupy Wyszehradzkiej generalnie wykazują wyższy poziom dostępności danych i otwartości izb parlamentarnych niż kraje Bałkanów Zachodnich. Istnieją jednak pozytywne przykłady przejrzystości parlamentarnej w krajach Bałkanów Zachodnich, a także znaczące braki w krajach Grupy Wyszehradzkiej.
        Najbardziej otwarte izby parlamentarne to Izba Poselska Republiki Czeskiej oraz Sejm i Senat RP. Najmniej otwarte są parlamenty Kosowa i Bośni i Hercegowiny.


        Dane związane z sesjami plenarnymi są bardziej dostępne niż dane związane z posiedzeniami komisji parlamentarnych w każdym sprawdzanym parlamencie.
        Wiele dokumentów jest publikowanych w formacie PDF i jako pliki tekstowe, które utrudniają odczytywanie ich przez urządzenia i ponowne ich użycie.


REKOMENDACJE:


        W wielu izbach parlamentarnych informacje o doświadczeniu zawodowym, wykształceniu i innych stanowiskach w sektorze publicznym zajmowanych przez ich członków są niekompletne i niemożliwe do porównania. Ten problem mógłby zostać rozwiązany, gdyby członkowie parlamentów zostali poproszeni o wypełnienie standaryzowanego kwestionariusza.
        Wiele izb parlamentarnych publikuje oświadczenia majątkowe swoich członków. Są one jednak publikowane jako pliki PDF i czasami nawet skany ręcznie pisanych dokumentów. Jakość oświadczeń majątkowych wzrośnie, jeśli deklaracje zostaną wydane w formacie do odczytu maszynowego (np. w formie danych tabelarycznych).
        Transkrypcje z sesji parlamentarnych są często publikowane w plikach PDF, gdzie nie istnieje standaryzowany podział na pojedynczych mówców. Proponujemy publikować transkrypcje w formatach HTML, XML lub JSON. Pozwoli to na zwiększenie możliwości przetwarzania tego rodzaju danych.
        W wielu parlamentach treści posiedzeń komisji są jedynie streszczane w krótkich raportach. Proponujemy publikować nagrania audio oraz wideo albo transkrypcje posiedzeń komisji.
        Wiele parlamentów publikuje jedynie wyniki wybranych głosowań, które miały miejsce podczas sesji plenarnych (np. tylko końcowe głosowanie nad projektem legislacyjnym). Radzimy, aby domyślnie publikować wszystkie wyniki głosowań (poza np. głosowaniami tajnymi).
        Wyniki głosowań, które odbywają się podczas posiedzeń komisji nie są skategoryzowane według głosów konkretnych posłów w żadnym badanym kraju. Rekomendujemy, aby rejestrować i publikować wyniki przynajmniej najważniejszych głosowań, które odbywają się podczas posiedzeń komisji.
        Większość parlamentów w regionie rejestruje nagrania audio i video sesji plenarnych. Rekomendujemy, aby udostępnić je do pobrania oraz wprowadzić znaczniki, które pozwalają na identyfikację mówców.
        Większość aktów prawnych publikowanych na stronach internetowych parlamentów (np. teksty projektów ustaw, poprawki, uchwały komisji, zaakceptowane akty legislacyjne) są publikowana w plikach PDF i DOC. Rekomendujemy, aby publikować akty prawne w formatach HTML, XML itd., aby zwiększyć możliwość ich maszynowego odczytu.
        Rekomendujemy udostępnianie surowych danych parlamentarnych w formatach możliwych do maszynowego odczytu i dostępnych zdalnie oraz umożliwienie ich masowego pobierania, np. przez API.


POZYTYWNE PRZYKŁADY:


        W Czechach, Polsce i Słowacji oficjalne strony parlamentarne zawierają informacje o tożsamości oraz kontakcie do asystentów członków parlamentu.
        Na Słowacji pensje asystentów członków parlamentu są ujawniane.
        Parlamenty Czech, Czarnogóry, Polski, Węgierski i Słowacji publikują oświadczenia majątkowe swoich członków.
        Polski Sejm jest jedyną izbą parlamentarną w regionie, która publikuje informacje o wydatkach posłów na podróże służbowe.
        Polski Senat jest jedyną izbą parlamentarną w regionie, która regularnie publikuje raporty o interakcjach senatorów i lobbystów, uwzględniając w nich nazwiska i miejsce zatrudnienia.
        W parlamentach Albanii, Węgier oraz polskim Sejmie, transkrypcje posiedzeń komisji są publikowane na oficjalnej stronie internetowej.
        Parlamenty Czech, Polski, Węgierski i Słowacji publikują wyniki wszystkich głosowań, które miały miejsce podczas sesji plenarnych oraz dane o głosach oddanych indywidualnie przez każdego członka parlamentu.
        W Bośni i Hercegowinie nagrania audio sesji plenarnych są publikowane w plikach, które można pobrać.
        W Polsce nagrania wideo sesji plenarnych zawierają znaczniki, które pozwalają na identyfikację poszczególnych mówców.
        Oficjalna strona internetowa czeskiej Izby Deputowanych zawiera graficzny przegląd przepływu każdego aktu prawnego w procesie legislacyjnym.
        Czeska Izba Deputowanych zapewnia regularnie aktualizowane surowe zrzuty parlamentarnych baz danych.
 
SERBIAN


Pristup informacijama o radu i aktivnostima parlamenta je preduslov za snažnu i stabilnu demokratiju. Parlamenti i parliamentarni domovi se dosta razlikuju u odnosu na opseg objavljivanja različitih podataka o svojim aktivnostima, kao i načinima na koje ih čine dostupnim javnosti. Načini objavljivanja parlamentarnih podataka jako su značajni jer određuju koliko je jednostavno objavljene podatke pretraživati, razumeti, preuzeti i koristiti.


Ova publikacija predstavlja rezultate istraživanja i procene dostupnosti i otvorenosti velikog broja najznačajnijih parlamentarnih podataka u 12 parlamentarnih domova u zemljama Višegradske grupe i Zapadnog Balkana (Albanija, Bosna i Hercegovina, Češka, Mađarska, Kosovo, Crna Gora, Poljska, Srbija i Slovačka). Cilj istraživanja je da unapredi dostupnost, kvalitet i mogućnosti korišćenja parlamentarnih informacija kroz uporedni prikaz parliamentarnih domova, identifikaciju njihovih snaga i slabosti, kao i preporuke za primenu specifičnih strategija radi otklanjanja tih slabosti.


GLAVNI NALAZI:
        Parlamentarni domovi u zemljama Višegradske grupe pokazuju veći stepen dostupnosti i otvorenosti parlamentarnih podataka nego parlamentarni domovi u zemljama Zapadnog Balkana. Postoje, međutim, pozitivni primeri transparentnosti parlamenata u zemljama Zapadnog Balkana, kao i značajni nedostaci u zemljama Višegradske grupe.
        Najotvoreniji parlamentarni domovi su Dom poslanika u Češkoj, i Donji dom i Senat u Poljskoj. Najmanje otvoreni su Dom kosovskog parlamenta i Dom naroda u Bosni i Hercegovini.
        Podaci o plenarnim sednicama su dostupniji i otvoreniji u poređenju sa podacima o sednicama odbora, i to u svim parlamentarnim domovima koji su bili predmet istraživanja.
        Veliki broj dokumenata je objavljeno u zatvorenim PDF i tekstualnim formatima, što onemogućava mašinsku čitljivost i korišćenje objavljenih podataka.


PREPORUKE:


        U mnogim parlamentarnim domovima, biografski podaci o profesionalnom iskustvu i formalnom obrazovanju narodnih poslanika, kao i njihovim drugim pozicijama u javnom sektoru, su nepotpuni i nije ih moguće uporediti. To bi se moglo jednostavno i efikasno prevazići ukoliko bi narodni poslanici popunili standardizovani upitnik.
        Mnogi domovi parlamenata objavljuju imovinske kartice narodnih poslanika. Međutim, one se uglavnom objavljuju kao PDF dokumenti, a nekada i kao skenirani i pisani dokumenti. Upotrebljivost imovinskih kartica bi porasla ukoliko bi se one objavljivale u mašinski čitljivim formatima (npr. tabelarni prikazi podataka).
        Traskripti sa parlamentarnih sednica često se objavljuju u formi nestandardizovanih PDF dokumenata, bez imenovanja govornika. Preporuka je da se transkripti objavljuju kao HTML, XML ili JSON dokumenti, čime bi se značajno povećala mogućnost korišćenja objavljenih informacija.
        U mnogim parlamentarnim domovima, izveštaji sa sednica odbora su dostupni u formi kratkog pisanog sažetka. Preporuka je da se izveštaji sa sednica odbora objavljuju u vidu audio ili video zapisa, ili kompletnih transkripata sa sednica.
        Mnogi parlamenti objavljuju samo deo rezultata glasanja sa plenarnih sednica (npr. samo konačne rezultate glasanja za zakone). Preporuka je da se objavljuju svi rezultati glasanja, bez izuzetka (osim ukoliko se tajnost glasanja eksplicitno ne zahteva).
        Rezultati glasanja na sednicama odbora ne sadrže imena narodnih poslanika koji su glasali ni u jednoj zemlji koja je učestvovala u istraživanju. Preporučuje se da se bar najvažniji rezultati glasanja sa sednica odbora beleže i objavljuju (npr. konačni rezultati glasanja za usvajanje zakona).
        Većina parlamenata u regionu poseduje audio i video zapise plenarnih sednica. Preporuka je da se omogući preuzimanje audio i video zapisa, uz oznake vremena govora za svakog govornika pojedinačno.
        Većina pravnih dokumenata na zvaničnim internet prezentacijama parlamenata (kao što su zakoni u proceduri, amandmani, odluke odbora, usvojeni zakoni) objavljuje se u PDF i DOC formatima. Preporuka je da se ovi dokumenti (predlozi zakona, amandmani, zakoni) objavljuju u struktuiranim formatima (HTML, XLM itd.), čime bi se unapredila mašinska čitljivost dokumenata.
        Preporučuje se da se parlamentarni podaci objavljuju kao sirovi podaci u mašinski čitljivim formatima, čime bi se omogućio daljinski pristup i preuzimanje velikog broja podataka, bilo putem aplikacionog programskog interfejsa (API) ili direktnim preuzimanjem.


 
POZITIVNI PRIMERI:


        Parlamenti u Češkoj, Poljskoj i Slovačkoj objavljuju lične i kontakt podatke zaposlenih u kancelarijama/klubovima narodnih poslanika na svojim zvaničnim internet prezentacijama.
        U Slovačkoj se objavljuju informacije o platama zaposlenih u kancelarijama/klubovima narodnih poslanika.
        Parlamenti u Češkoj, Crnoj Gori, Poljskoj, Mađarski i Slovačkoj objavljuju imovinske kartice narodnih poslanika.
        Donji dom parlamenta u Poljskoj je jedini parlamentarni dom u regionu koji objavljuje informacije o putnim troškovima narodnih poslanika.
        Poljski Senat je jedini parlamentarni dom u regionu koji redovno objavljuje izveštaje o lobiranju između narodnih poslanika i lobista, uključujući njihova imena i poslovne veze.
        Parlamenti Albanije, Mađarske i Donji dom parlamenta u Poljskoj objavljuju detaljne transkripte sa sednica odbora na zvaničnoj internet prezentaciji parlamenta.
        Parlamenti u Češkoj, Poljskoj, Mađarskoj i Slovačkoj objavljuju sve rezultate glasanja na plenarnim sednicama, bez izuzetka, navodeći imena narodnih poslanika.
        U Bosni i Hercegovini, audio zapisi sa plenarnih sednica objavljuju se u formatima koji omogućavaju njihovo preuzimanje.
        U Poljskoj, video zapisi plenarnih sednica uključuju i oznake vremena govora za svakog govornika pojedinačno.
        Zvanična internet prezentacija češkog Doma poslanika sadrži grafičke prikaze puta zakona za sve zakone u proceduri. 
        Češki Dom poslanika redovno objavljuje ažurirane i sirove podatke iz svoje baze.
 
SLOVAK


Nutnou podmienkou silnej a stabilnej demokracie je dostupnosť informácií o činnosti národného parlamentu. Rozsah, v akom parlament zverejňuje údaje o svojej činnosti i spôsob, akým ich poskytuje verejnosti sa u jednotlivých parlamentov a ich komôr značne líši. Spôsob zverejňovania parlamentných dát je veľmi dôležitý, pretože určuje, ako ľahko sa potom dajú prehľadávať, pochopiť, získať alebo opätovne použiť.


Táto publikácia skúma a vyhodnocuje dostupnosť a otvorenosť veľkého množstva kľúčových druhov parlamentných dát v 12 komorách parlamentov Vyšehradských krajín a krajín západného Balkánu (Albánsko, Bosna a Hercegovina, Česká republika, Maďarsko, Kosovo, Čierna hora, Poľsko, Srbsko, Slovensko). Jej cieľom je pomôcť zvýšiť dostupnosť, kvalitu a znovupoužiteľnosť parlamentných informácií porovnaním týchto parlamentných komôr, rozpoznaním ich silných a slabých stránok a odporučením konkrétnych postupov ako ich zlepšiť.


KĽÚČOVÉ ZISTENIA:


        Komory parlamentov vo Vyšehradských krajinách vykazujú vo všeobecnosti vyššiu mieru dostupnosti a otvorenosti parlamentných dát než komory parlamentov v krajinách západného Balkánu. I v západobalkánskych krajinách však existujú pozitívne príklady parlamentnej transparentnosti a aj vo Vyšehradských krajinách značné nedostatky.
        Najotvorenejšími komorami parlamentu sú Poslanecká snemovňa Českej republiky, poľský Sejm a poľský Senát. Najmenej otvorené sú kosovský parlament a Snemovňa národov v Bosne a Hercegovine.
        Vo všetkých skúmaných parlamentoch sú údaje súvisiace so schôdzami parlamentu dostupnejšie a otvorenejšie než údaje súvisiace so schôdzami výborov.
        Veľa dokumentov sa zverejňuje vo formáte PDF a v textových formátoch, ktoré bránia strojovému spracovaniu a preto aj znovupoužiteľnosti dát.


ODPORÚČANIA:


        Informácie ako životopis, vzdelanie či ďalšie funkcie vo verejnom sektore sú v mnohých parlamentoch neúplné a neporovnateľné. Ľahko by sa to dalo zlepšiť tým, že poslanci by vypĺňali štandardizovaný dotazník.
        Veľa parlamentov zverejňuje majetkové priznania poslancov. Zverejňujú sa však ako PDF súbory, niekedy dokonca ako skeny ručne vypísaných dokumentov. Kvalitu majetkových priznaní by zvýšilo ich zverejňovanie v strojovo čitateľnom formáte (napr. v tabuľke).
        Doslovné prepisy schôdzí parlamentu sa často zverejňujú v PDF súboroch, v ktorých nie sú jednotným spôsobom vyznačení jednotliví rečníci. Veľmi sa odporúča zverejňovať prepisy v HTML, XML alebo JSON formátoch, značne sa tým zvýši znovupoužiteľnosť dát.
        O schôdzach výborov sa v mnohých parlamentoch informuje len v podobe krátkej zápisnice. Odporúča sa pripravovať a zverejňovať zvukové záznamy, videozáznamy alebo doslovné prepisy zo schôdzí výborov.
        Veľa parlamentov zverejňuje výsledky len vybraných hlasovaní zo schôdzí parlamentu (napr. len konečné hlasovania o návrhoch zákonov). Odporúča sa zverejňovať výsledky v zásade všetkých hlasovaní (t.j. len okrem tých, kde sa priamo vyžaduje tajné hlasovanie).
        V žiadnej zo skúmaných krajín sa nezaznamenávajú výsledky hlasovaní vo výboroch menovite. Odporúča sa zaznamenávať a zverejňovať hlasy jednotlivých členov výboru aspoň pri najdôležitejších hlasovaniach (napr. konečné hlasovania o návrhoch zákonov).
        Väčšina parlamentov nahráva zo schôdzí parlamentu audio alebo videozáznamy. Odporúča sa umožniť stiahnutie týchto nahrávok a vyznačiť v nich časy vystúpení jednotlivých rečníkov.
        Väčšina legislatívnych dokumentov (napr. znenia návrhov zákonov, pozmeňovacie návrhy, uznesenia výborov, schválené zákony) sa na oficiálnych weboch parlamentov zverejňuje ako PDF alebo DOC súbory. Odporúča sa zverejňovať legislatívne dokumenty (návrhy, pozmeňovacie návrhy, zákony) v štruktúrovaných formátoch (HTML, XML, atď.), ktoré sú vhodnejšie pre ďalšie strojové spracovanie.
        Silno sa odporúča poskytovať surové parlamentné dáta v strojovo čitateľnom formáte a umožniť ich hromadné sťahovanie buď prostredníctvom API alebo ako dátové súbory.
 
POZITÍVNE PRÍKLADY:


        V Českej republike, Poľsku a na Slovensku sú na oficiálnom webe parlamentu zverejnené mená a kontaktné informácie o asistentoch poslancov.
        Na Slovensku sú uvedené aj odmeny asistentov poslancov.
        Parlamenty v Českej republike, Čiernej hore, Poľsku, Maďarsku a na Slovensku zverejňujú majetkové priznania poslancov.
        Poľský Sejm je jedinou komorou parlamentu, ktorá zverejňuje cestovné náklady poslancov. Hoci sú tieto informácie neúplné, je to rozhodne krok správnym smerom.
        Poľský Senát je jedinou komorou parlamentu, ktorá zverejňuje pravidelné správy o stretnutiach senátorov s lobistami vrátane mena a firemnej príslušnosti lobistu.
        V parlamentoch Albánska, Maďarska a v poľskom Sejme sa zaznamenávajú doslovné prepisy schôdzí výborov a zverejňujú sa na oficiálnom webe parlamentu.
        Parlamenty v Českej republike, Poľsku , Maďarsku a na Slovensku zverejňujú menovité výsledky v zásade všetkých hlasovaní zo schôdzí parlamentu.
        V Bosne a Hercegovine sa audiozáznamy zo schôdzí parlamentu dajú aj stiahnuť.

INTRODUCTION
 
Parliaments are among the most powerful institutions in both democratic and non-democratic countries. Information about members of parliaments (MPs), their activity, the legislative process and its outputs therefore count as one most important pieces of information produced by the public sector. It is crucial for transparent, just and effective governance that parliamentary information is published timely, completely, impartially and that it is free to obtain and re-use.


Moreover, technologies of the 21st century enable parliamentary information to be published online which greatly increases its accessibility and usefulness. It is an internationally recognized best practice that the public sector discloses information in form so called open data , meaning that there are no disproportionate legal or technical obstacles to obtaining and re-using it.


A necessary condition of functioning democracy is availability of information about activities of various representative bodies, most notably national parliaments. Voters need an abundance of high quality information to make responsible decisions and to control whether elected representatives perform their duties. Parliaments, as well as local representative bodies and other similar institutions vary considerably in a degree to which the produce and publish various data. In this respect, there are several key criteria of good practice:


        Whether parliamentary data is copyrighted and whether citizens can freely re-used such data
        Whether the parliament publishes data proactively and free of charge
        Whether parliamentary data is published online (e.g. on the official parliamentary website)
        Whether parliamentary data is available in machine readable formats
        Whether the parliament enables advanced use of data, e.g. whether it provides API (application programming interface)
        Whether parliamentary data is published timely, i.e. well in advanced before relevant events (e.g. before a session) or soon after data is produced (e.g. after a session)
        Whether parliamentary data is published permanently or whether only information on the current parliamentary term is available
        Whether the official parliamentary website is easily searchable and whether advanced parametric search queries are possible
        Whether the way parliamentary data is published discriminate against certain groups of citizens, e.g. language minorities.


It is obvious that the issue of availability and quality of parliamentary data is closely connected to issues of human rights, democratic principles of governance, general accessibility of information, transparency of public finances etc.


National parliaments and other representative bodies vary significantly in an extent to which they publish various data about their activities and in ways how they provide them to the public. These ways of publishing data are very important because it determines how easy it is to search, understand, obtain and re-use this data and it in turn determines how the data impacts political engagement of citizens and political accountability of the MPs.


When advocating for increased openness, one of the most effective tools is a comparative study of several cases. Therefore, it is useful to have a comparative study of parliamentary data openness across several representative bodies when advocating for a better standard of data openness in one parliament. Moreover, comparative studies generate knowledge about best practices and proven solutions to specific problems.


For these reasons, it is necessary to start a global monitoring of parliamentary data openness across the world Such global comparative research would be similar to monitoring of democracy and civil rights conducted annually by the Freedom House , to monitoring of corruption by Transparency International  or to monitoring of budgetary transparency by International Budgetary Partnership .


There have been several attempts to capture parliamentary data openness in various regions. Most notable examples include a comparative study covering several Latin American congresses by the Latin American Network for Legislative Transparency , a study by a Serbian parliamentary monitoring organization CRTA covering Turkey and several Balkans countries  or a study covering Eastern European parliaments coordinated by an American organization National Democratic Institute . Last but not least, KohoVoit.eu, a Czech and Slovak parliamentary monitoring organization surveyed parliamentary openness of 14 Czech Regional Assemblies  and published a comprehensive global survey monitoring availability and openness of plenary voting results in over 270 parliamentary chambers .


There has been, however, no truly global effort to systematically compare openness of parliamentary chambers on more than one type of data. For these reasons we decided to further the progress in this area by performing an evaluation of parliamentary data availability and openness in 11 parliamentary chambers in the Visegrad and Western Balkan countries. This publication presents results of this evaluation. It is meant primarily as an advocacy tool that can be used to increase standards of parliamentary data openness


The publication covers the following countries and chambers of their national parliaments:


        Albania – Parliament (Kuvendi), the unicameral national parliament 
        Bosnia and Hercegovina – House of Representatives (Представнички дом / Predstavnički dom), the lower house of the Parliamentary Assembly (Парламентарна скупштина / Parlamentarna skupština) ; House of Peoples (Дом народа / Dom naroda), the upper house
        Czech Republic – Chamber of Deputies (Poslanecká sněmovna) , the lower house of the Parliament (Parlament); Senate (Senát) , the upper house
        Hungary – National Assembly (Országgyűlés), the unicameral national parliament 
        Kosovo – Assembly (Kuvendi, Скупштина / Skupština),the unicameral national parliament 
        Montenegro – Parliament (Скупштина / Skupština), the unicameral national parliament 
        Poland – Sejm , the lower house of the National Assembly (Parlament); Senate (Senat) , the upper house
        Serbia – National Assembly (Народна скупштина / Narodna skupština) , the unicameral national parliament 
        Slovakia – National Council (Národná rada) , the unicameral national parliament


Each of these parliamentary chambers is reviewed using a comprehensive survey to determine accessibility and openness of 52 key types of parliamentary data on the official parliamentary website. The chambers are then compared using a rigorous and impartial methodology in order to identify specific strengths and weaknesses, as well as specific technical solutions how to mitigate deficiencies in one country that already exist in another country.


The publication is split into several sections. In the first section, a brief overview of the parliamentary data availability and openness among the compare countries is given and specific strengths and weaknesses of individual parliamentary chambers are outlined. The second section describes in detail the survey used to assess parliamentary data availability and openness and methodology used to compare the parliamentary chambers.


The third and fourth sections contain the results of the survey. The third section is divided into sub-sections according to various types of parliamentary data grouped into three categories – data on MPs, data on plenary sessions and data on committee sessions. A scorecard of each type of data containing results of the survey is presented and commented on. This allows a reader to compare openness of various parliamentary chambers on a single type of data. The fourth and final section is divided into sub-sections according to parliamentary chambers. A scorecard of each chamber containing results of the survey is presented and commented on. This allows a reader to compare openness of various types of data in a single parliamentary chamber.


This project is a collaborative effort of the following organizations:


        CRTA  (Serbia)
        Fundacja ePaństwo  (Poland)
        K-Monitor  (Hungary)
        KohoVolit.eu  (Czech Republic and Slovakia)
        KRIIK  (Albania)
        Zašto ne  (Bosnia and Hercegovina)


It has been financially supported by the International Visegrad Fund. The project endorses international efforts to increase accessibility, openness and usefulness of parliamentary data, especially Poplus, a global federation of collaborative civil coders . The evaluation is based on the Declaration on Parliamentary Openness ; an international covenant drafted by the international community of parliamentary monitoring organizations, most importantly by the National Democratic Institute , the Sunlight Foundation  an association of Latin American parliamentary monitoring organizations Latin American Network for Legislative Transparency . Since its launch in 2012, the Declaration has been endorsed by over 140 parliamentary monitoring organizations in some 70 countries and by a number of national parliaments and other representative bodies. The Declaration contains 44 articles defining specific conditions that a national parliament or other representative body should meet in order to be considered open.
 








OVERVIEW


PARLIAMENTARY DATA AVAILABILITY AND OPENNESS
 




 
The main finding of the publication is that the parliamentary chambers in the Visegrad countries generally exhibit a higher level of parliamentary data availability and openness that parliamentary chambers in the Western Balkans countries. There are, however, positive examples of parliamentary transparency in the Western Balkans, as well as significant shortcomings in the Visegrad countries.


According to a quantitative indicator constructed to evaluate data availability and openness describe in the following section of this publication, the most open parliamentary chambers are the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic, the Polish Sejm and the Polish Senate. The least open chambers are the parliament of Kosovo and the House of People of Bosnia and Hercegovina.


The following table shows values of the quantitative indicator (“Average indicator”) and sub-indicators that focus on four categories of parliamentary data – data on MPs, plenary sessions, committee sessions and the legislative process.

Poland - Upper        75%        80%        50%        32%        59%
Serbia        25%        70%        50%        24%        42%
Slovakia        42%        80%        23%        60%        51%


 
As far as providing data on MPs are concerned, every official parliamentary website in the surveyed region contains webpages with profiles of individual MPs, as it is common world-wide. The extent, completeness and the level of detail of information published about MPs on these profiles varies, however, significantly among the survey parliaments.


Some parliamentary chambers publish MPs’ CVs or some information in a CV-like structure (e.g. information on professional background or formal education). This information is, however, often self-reported and in many cases missing entirely. The quality of data on MPs professional background, formal education and other positions that they hold in the public sector would increase if the MPs were asked to fill in a standardized questionnaire.


All surveyed parliamentary chambers provide means for citizens to contact their MPs, usually via email or postal addresses, except of the parliament of Kosovo. It only publishes postal addresses of MPs that are often incomplete (e.g. missing street name and house number). Several parliamentary websites (e.g. Czech, Polish or Slovak) provide identity of personal staff members and their contact details. The Slovak parliament also discloses staffers’ salaries.


In a number of countries (the Czech Republic, Montenegro, Poland and Slovakia), the official parliamentary websites contain MPs’ declaration of assets that allow citizens in a varying degree of detail and completeness asses MPs’ incomes and expenses. The Polish Sejm is the only parliamentary chamber in the region that also discloses information about MPs’ travel expenses, be it incomplete. It should be noted, however, that the asset declarations are usually published as scans of documents, sometimes hand-written, and are not therefore machine readable. The quality of asset declarations would be increased if the declarations were released in machine readable formats (e.g. as tabular data).
A notable example of parliamentary transparency is the Polish Senate that is the only parliamentary chamber among the surveyed countries that publishes a report on interactions of MPs with lobbyists, including their names and professional affiliations. It is always questionable, however, whether such reports (as well as the above mentioned declaration of assets) are complete and accurate.


Data related to plenary sessions is more available and open than data related to committee sessions in every parliamentary chamber surveyed. Every chamber currently publishes word-by-word transcripts of plenary sessions. In many cases, however, these transcripts are published in native PDF files where individual speakers are clearly identified in a way that would simplify machine readability. This is the case in Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia.


In other chambers, e.g. in the Czech Chamber of Deputies, transcripts are published in HTML format and MPs are identified by linking to their profile webpages. It is highly recommended to publish transcripts in HTML format since it significantly increases re-usability of the data.


Only few parliamentary chambers in the surveyed region publish word-by-word transcripts of committee sessions. These positive examples of parliamentary transparency include the parliaments Albania and Hungary and the Polish Sejm. In the remaining chambers, only short summaries of sessions are produced, except of the parliament of Montenegro where no reports of committee sessions are published.


The written summaries obviously suffer from a significant loss of information since they do not capture precisely of what is spoken during committee sessions. The level of detail and precision, moreover, varies significantly among parliamentary chambers, among committees within individual chambers and sometimes even among session of the same committee.


Audio or video recordings of committee sessions are also far from common. Positive examples of parliamentary chambers that do produce such recordings include the Polish Senate, the Czech Chamber of Deputies, and the parliament of Serbia. In the two latter cases, however, only some sessions are recorded. In most cases, therefore, neither audio or video recordings nor transcripts of sessions are available. It is thus recommended to produce and publish either recordings or word-by-word transcripts of committee sessions 


Results of votes taken during plenary sessions are published by names of individual MPs in every surveyed parliamentary chamber. However, the results are published as PDF or text files in Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia which again limits their re-usability. It is recommended to publish results of each vote on a separate webpage as it is done in the Czech Republic, Poland or Slovakia. This assures that votes are easy to search and share.


Every parliamentary chamber in the region is equipped with electronic voting machines. However, only some votes are recorded in most of them. Since it is ultimately up to the public and not up to the parliament to decide which votes are of interest or importance, it is advised that results of all votes are published by default (i.e. unless secret voting is explicitly specified).


Results of votes taken during committee sessions are not published (and often not even recorded) in any of the surveyed parliamentary chambers. This is most likely due to the fact that premises where committees hold their sessions are usually not equipped with voting machines and mobile machines are not available.


Since committees often do not have that many members, results of votes can be relatively easily recorded even by hand. Given the fact that committee decision-making is in many situations a key step in the legislative process, it is recommended to record and publish results of at least the most important votes taken during committee sessions (e.g. final votes on legislation).


All the surveyed parliamentary chambers produce either audio or video recordings of plenary sessions except of the parliament of Kosovo. In some cases, video streams can only be viewed live. It is recommended the recordings to be available for download (as they are e.g. in the Czech Republic or Bosnia and Hercegovina) and to include timestamps that mark individual speakers (as they do in e.g. Poland).


Most surveyed parliamentary chambers publish full texts of proposed bills, as well as approved legislation. In many cases, texts of amendments or committee resolutions are not published. In almost all cases, these documents are published in PDF or DOC formats. This limits re-usability of data because these texts are usually not very well standardized. It is recommended to publish legal documents (proposals, amendments, law) in structured formats (HTML, XLM etc.) that improve machine readability.


Many official parliamentary websites in the region group documents related to one bill proposal together on one webpage. This practice is recommended since it simplifies orientation in the legislative process. A notable positive example is the website of the Czech Chamber of Deputies that contains graphical overview of each bill’s flow in the legislative process.


The Hungarian parliamentary is the only chamber in the region, that currently provides an API that would enable remote access to the parliamentary database for software developers (for MP’s data and voting). 


The Czech Chamber of Deputies, however, at least provides regularly updated dumps of raw data, including information on MPs, their memberships in various intra- and extra-parliamentary institutions, voting results and information on bills and their flow in the legislative process. Providing raw parliamentary data in machine readable formats that enables bulk download is strongly recommended. 








EVALUATION METHODOLOGY


DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH SURVEY
 
This publication presents an overview of parliamentary data availability and openness in 11 parliamentary chambers of Visegrad and Western Balkan countries. The overview was derived from results of an online research survey. A survey questionnaire was filled out by experts on parliamentary data in the surveyed countries. This chapter provides a detailed description of the survey questionnaire structure, individual questions and possible answers. The survey is accessible online .


The following diagram shows a structure of the survey questionnaire. Each coloured box represents one survey question or, in case of multiple choice questions, one possible answer to a question that a researcher can choose from. Colour represents a type of question or answer. Arrows represent how a research navigates throughout the survey.


 


Diagram 3: Structure of the research survey questionnaire
 
 
First, the researcher is asked to select one of the 11 parliamentary chambers to indicate which one his or her answers apply to and a link to the official website of the parliamentary chamber for quick and easy reference. Then, he or she selects one of the 52 types of parliamentary data covered by the survey or one miscellaneous category (“Other, not listed here (specify in the comments below)”). The types of data covered are as follows:

        Invitations to plenary sessions
        Agenda of plenary sessions
        Vote results in plenary sessions listed by individual MPs

        Invitations to committee sessions
        Agenda of committee sessions
        Vote results in committee sessions listed by individual MPs
        Transcript of committee sessions
        Audio recording of committee sessions
        Video recording of committee sessions
        Written summaries of committee sessions


DATA ON THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS:


        Full texts of legislative proposals
        Full texts of amendments to legislative proposals
        Overview of legislative proposals' flow in the legislative process
        Full texts of approved legislation
        Full texts of committee resolutions


Then, the researcher defines a time period when answers of all the subsequent questions regarding the type of data he or she has selected remain constant. For example, let say that from 1990 to 1993, a parliamentary chamber did not publish transcripts of committee sessions, from 1993 to 2010, they published them as a text file and since 2010, they have also provided a bulk-download option to this data. In this case, the researcher would define three distinct periods when answers of the questions regarding the transcripts of committee sessions would be internally constant: 1990 – 1993, 1993 – 2010 and 2010 – 2014. For sake of simplicity, the questionnaire only operates on the level of one year. A change occurring in February is treated the same way as a change occurring in November of the same year. Also, time periods shorter than one year are omitted.


Subsequently, the researcher fills out the rest of the questions for the specified type of data in the specified period of time. This is then repeated as many times as necessary to provide complete account of all types of data in a time period from a chamber-specific starting point up to 2014. These starting points vary across parliamentary chambers:


        Parliament (Kuvendi) of Albania – Parliamentary elections in 1990
        House of Representatives (Представнички дом / Predstavnički dom) of Bosnia and Hercegovina – Parliamentary elections in 1990
        House of Peoples (Дом народа / Dom naroda) of Bosnia and Hercegovina – Parliamentary elections in 1990
        Chamber of Deputies (Poslanecká sněmovna) of Czech Republic – Foundation of the Czech Republic in 1993
        Senate (Senát) of Czech Republic – Foundation of the chamber in 1996
        National Assembly (Országgyűlés) of Hungary – Parliamentary elections in 1990
        Assembly (Kuvendi, Скупштина / Skupština) of Kosovo – Foundation of Kosovo in 2008
        Parliament (Скупштина / Skupština) of Montenegro – Foundation of Kosovo in 2006
        Sejm of Poland – Parliamentary elections in 1991
        Senate (Senat) of Poland – Parliamentary elections in 1991
        National Assembly (Народна скупштина / Narodna skupština) of Serbia – Parliamentary elections in 1990
        National Council (Národná rada) of Slovakia – Foundation of Slovakia in 1993


In case of parliamentary chambers that existed before 1990, the survey does not cover this previous period. Due to non-democratic regimes and the resulting weaker political position of parliaments in the countries, parliamentary data did not have such an importance for citizens. Besides, modern information technologies only started to impact parliaments not long before 1990. In some cases, older parliamentary data is available online. For example, a joint project the Czech and Slovak parliaments has digitalized available transcripts of plenary speeches, text of bill proposals and voting records from several federal- and state-level representative bodies in the area of former Czechoslovakia since 1848 .


For each type of data and time period, the researcher first specifies availability of the data. Possible answers are:


        Data does not exists
        I am not sure if data exists
        Data exists but it is not accessible on the official parliamentary website
        Data is accessible on the official parliamentary website


Only the last answer leads to additional question since the survey is only concerned with data on the parliamentary websites and not for example with data in parliamentary libraries. The second question about a data type asks about formats (“Choose all of the following sentences that apply to this type of parliamentary data”). Possible answers are:


        Accessible online in a file that does not allow copying (e.g. an image or a PDF file)
        Accessible online in a “native” PDF file (meaning it is possible to copy data from the PDF using “copy” and “paste” functions
        Accessible online in a text or table file (e.g. Microsoft Word, Excel)
        Accessible online as a webpage (i.e. in HTML format)
        Accessible online in a data format (e.g. JSON, XML)


This question is crucial since data formats determine the extent of accessibility and reusability of the data. When constructing the possible answers, we follow a methodology applied by the Open Knowledge Foundation; a British organization specialized in researching open data. It constructs so called Open Data Index that quantifies the level of openness of several key types of data produced by the public sector in a number of countries .


The first two answers concern machine readability – that is whether a piece of data can be understood as such by a machine and therefore whether it can be automatically processed and analysed. Images and scanned documents are generally much easier to machine read than “native” PDF files that have machine readability built in. The second answer concerns whether the files containing the data in question can actually be opened and edited. Such data is obviously much more easily to re-use. The third answer concerns whether the data is contain in separate files that must be opened in order to be accessed or whether the data is actually present on a website as a raw text. Again, the latter case makes the data much easier to access and process, especially in large quantities. The last answer concerns advanced data formats that are enriched by metadata.


One type of data can be published in several different formats at the same time. In such cases, researchers were asked to indicate all the data formats and to provide further explanation if necessary. Since the above described answers are hierarchical and ordered from the least open to the most open, only the most open option is used when evaluating data openness of a parliamentary chamber. The above described options are most likely strictly mutually exclusive and completely exhaustive. No additional category of formats has been detected by researchers except for various formats of audio and video recordings published by parliaments. In these cases, the formats are classified as “Other format” in the following text.


Then, the researcher is asked to answer several questions about the type of data. First, there is a question asking whether the type of data is searchable using the built-in search engine of the parliamentary chamber. If yes a description of the search option is required. Second, there is a question asking whether a bulk-option download option is provided by the parliament. This could refer to raw database dumps, manually aggregated files or an API. If yes a description of such an option is required. Third, there is a question asking whether the researcher is aware of any mechanism that prevents the parliamentary data from being automatically downloaded using web scrapers. This could refer to for example the use of captcha, a limited number of sessions per one IP address etc. If yes a description of such a mechanism is required.


Fourth, the researcher is asked whether the data appears to be complete. This question is rather problematic since it more than other question relies of subjective evaluation and the extent of knowledge on part of the researcher. Also, researcher’s answer is in principle very difficult to verify. If the data appears to be incomplete (for example only some voting results are published) a further description is required. Additionally, the researcher can leave miscellaneous comments regarding the parliamentary chamber.


In some cases, additional context or instructions are added to a question. Here is a complete list of such appendices:


        Overview of legislative proposals' flow in the legislative process – This includes information on how a legislative proposal moves in the legislative process aggregated in one place. It may include e.g. information on how is its sponsor, when it was debated, how it was decided on.
        Full texts of committee resolutions – A committee resolution is a formal document that states what the committee decided on during a session. It is usually an output of a committee session. It is not identical to a transcript of a committee session.
        Invitations to plenary sessions and Invitations to committee sessions –An invitation specifies, most importantly, when and where a session takes place (and possibly other information). Note that this is different from agenda (program) of a session that specifies content of the session (e.g. what legislative proposals will be discussed).
        Agenda of plenary sessions and Agenda of committee sessions – Agenda (program) specifies, most importantly content of a session (e.g. which legislative proposals will be discussed). Note that this is different from invitation to a session that specifies, most importantly, when and where a session takes place.
        Information on MPs' electoral results – This means that the official parliamentary website (and not e.g. a website of the electoral committee of the country) includes information on performance in elections of each individual MP. This may include e.g. which elections he or she took part in, identification of his or her constituency, percentage of votes obtained. If there is such information available, please describe it in the comment section of this form (below).
        Information on MPs' professional background – This may include e.g. list of previous occupations, references, CVs, list of companies owned by an MP. If there is such information available, please describe it in the comment section of this form (below).
        Information on MPs’ formal education – This may include names of schools, academic degrees obtained. If there is such information available, please describe it in the comment section of this form (below).
        Information on MPs' political affiliation – This may include party membership or other form of affiliation. Note that this is not the same as membership in parliamentary party groups which is covered by a different question in this form. If there is information on political affiliation of MPs available, please describe it in the comment section of this form (below).
        Information on MPs' parliamentary committee membership – This includes memberships in committees organized by the parliament and not other non-parliamentary institutions that are also called "committees". If there is such information available, please describe it in the comment section of this form (below).
        Information on MPs' other electoral mandates (e.g. mayor etc.) – This includes information on other positions that are obtained by elections, e.g. in local administration. If there is such information available, please describe it in the comment section of this form (below).
        Information on MPs' contact information and Information on MPs' personal staff contact information – This may include e.g. email address, address of an office, phone number. If there is such information available, please describe it in the comment section of this form (below).
        Information on MPs' personal staff identity – This includes, primarily, names of the staff. It may also include e.g. position of the staff. If there is such information available, please describe it in the comment section of this form (below).
        Information on MPs' presence in social networks – This may include e.g. link to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn. If there is such information available, please describe it in the comment section of this form (below).
        Information on MPs' seating order – This identifies where an MP sits in the chamber.
        Proposed legislation listed by individual MPs – This is a list of legislation proposed by an MP. It may or may not be linked to other information on the website (e.g. text of the proposed legislation).
        Amendments to proposed legislation listed by individual MPs – This is a list of legislative amendments proposed by an MP. It may or may not be linked to other information on the website (e.g. text of the amendments).
        Transcripts of plenary sessions and transcripts of committee sessions – This is a word-by-word transcription of a session.
        Written summaries of plenary sessions and written summaries of committee sessions – This is a condensed version of a transcript of a session. It informs e.g. who spoke during the session but does not include word-by-word transcription.


Answers provided by the researchers were written into a CSV file that is accessible online . The two subsequent sections of this publication contain the results of the survey. The following section is divided into sub-sections according to parliamentary chambers. A scorecard of each chamber containing results of the survey is presented and commented on. This allows a reader to compare openness of various types of data in a single parliamentary chamber. The final section is divided into sub-section according to various types of parliamentary data grouped into three categories – data on members of parliaments, data on plenary sessions and data on committee sessions. A scorecard of each type of data containing results of the survey is presented and commented on. This allows a reader to compare openness of various parliamentary chambers on a single type of data.


DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPARATIVE INDICATOR


In order to compare the level of availability and openness of data across the parliamentary chambers surveyed, the questionnaire results must be converted into a quantitative indicator. There are, of course, many ways how to do that and thus there are many different values that various versions of such an indicator can take. How countries score in relation to each other may therefore vary but there is a general level of robustness nevertheless – a parliamentary chamber that produces most of the data surveyed will generally score better than a parliamentary chamber that produces almost no data at all regardless how a quantitative indicator measuring this is constructed.


Still, it is important to explain in detail how the quantitative indicator used in this publication is constructed and why it is constructed this way. This is the aim of this section of the publication. The main decision-marking principle employed when constructing the indicator is usefulness of the parliamentary data for citizens. We therefore survey not only whether a type of data is published on the official parliamentary website but also in what format.


It is possible to reflect how many years of data are published (e.g. whether a parliamentary chamber publishes certain type of data since, say, 1990 or since 2013) and whether the data appears to be complete. A quantitative indicator could also account for timeliness, i.e. when the data is published (whether it is published well in advanced before a session in case of data related to future sessions, such as invitations or agenda of sessions; whether it is published soon after a session in case of data related to past session, such as transcripts or voting results).


We, however, do not take these criteria into account for sake of simplicity. In some cases, judging how the criteria are met would be technically difficult (e.g. in case of completeness of data) and in other cases, it would be highly subjective. We also avoid estimating quality of data – i.e. whether summaries of session produced by one parliamentary chamber better reflect what was said and decided than summaries produced by some other chamber. There are multiple external factors that limit comparability of parliamentary chambers.


The qualitative indicator is broken down into four sub-indicators, one for each category of parliamentary data – sub-indicator evaluating data on MPs, plenary sessions, committee sessions and the legislative process. The first sub-indicator (data on MPs) is constructed based on the following typed of data:


        Professional background
        Formal education
        Political affiliation
        Committee membership
        Other electoral mandates
        Positions in other public institutions
        Contact information
        Personal staff identity
        Parliamentary income
        Non-parliamentary income from public sources
        Non-parliamentary income from private sources
        Official travel expenses
        Official interactions with lobbyists


Unlike the other sub-indicators, this one does not take the format in which the data is published into account because there is very little variety among the surveyed parliamentary chambers as well as among the surveyed data types – in all the surveyed chambers, every MP has a profile webpage either listing the data in question (therefore in HTML format) or links to relevant documents that are in all cases PDF (scans or native). 


The survey questionnaire used to collect information on data availability contains questions about 27 types of data regarding MPs. However, only the above mentioned data types are included in the construction of the sub-indicator because they are the most crucial. All of the data types are treated equally (i.e. they are not weighted when calculating the value of the sub-indicator) since weighting them would be highly subjective.


The sub-indicator is calculated a very straightforward way: Each parliamentary chamber is awarded one point for each point for each type of data available on the official parliamentary website. The sum of points is then divided by the maximum amount of points achievable (13 points). The product is a value between 0 % and 100 %.


The three remaining sub-indicators are based on the following data types:


        PLENARY SESSIONS
        Invitations
        Agenda
        Transcripts
        Summaries
        Voting results
        Audio recordings
        Video recordings
        COMMITTEE SESSIONS
        Invitations
        Agenda
        Transcripts
        Summaries
        Voting results
        Audio recordings
        Video recordings
        LEGISLATIVE PROCESS
        Bill proposals
        Legislative amendments
        Approved legislation
        Overviews of the legislative process
        Committee resolutions


All three sub-indicators are calculated the same way as the sub-indicator on MPs but take the format in which the data is published into account. Each parliamentary chamber is awarded zero points for a data type that is not published on the official parliamentary website and a certain number of points for each type of data the is published – 1 point for data that are currently published as scanned PDFs, 2 points for data published as native PDFs, 3 points for data in DOC, XLS and similar formats and 4 points for data in HTML formats. 


The Czech parliament is awarded 5 points in some cases because it provides bulk downloads of some data types in CSV format. The sum of the points is again divided by the maximum amount of points possible – five points multiplied by the number of data types in each sub-category of data (plenary sessions, committee sessions and the legislative process).


In some cases, certain data types effectively replace other data types and are therefore merged into one meta-type of data. Specifically, invitations and agenda of plenary or committee sessions are considered only one type of data because in many parliamentary chambers, invitations are not published as separate documents but as a part of session agenda.


Audio and video recordings are also merged into one meta-type. It is sufficient if a parliamentary chamber publishes either type of recordings in order to be awarded points. All recordings are awarded four points regardless of the format in which they are published.


Transcripts and summaries from plenary or committee sessions are also merged into one meta-type since parliamentary chambers that produce one type of data usually do not produce the other one. Transcripts are, however, clearly superior to summaries because they reflect discussions during a session with maximum precision (assuming they are complete and precise) while summaries always loose some information. Therefore, in cases when only summaries are published, the amount of points awarded is divided by two to reflect this.


In cases when two data types merged into one meta-type are published in different formats, the superior format (i.e. the one with the higher number of points to be awarded) is used in calculation.
 




















PROFILES OF PARLIAMENTARY DATA TYPES


 
The following section of this publication contains an overview of parliamentary data availability and openness that is broken down by individual types of parliamentary data. Each section briefly introduces a given type of data and discusses its importance for parliamentary transparency and political accountability. It then describes whether and how the given type of data is published by the surveyed parliamentary chambers. Accompanying diagrams show formats of published data that can be retrieved from the official parliamentary websites.


MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT


This section of the publication overviews availability of parliamentary data on MPs. Unlike the sections on plenary and committee sessions and the legislative process data it does not discuss specific data formats in which the information is released because there is very little variety among the surveyed parliamentary chambers as well as among the surveyed data types.


In all the surveyed chambers, every MP has a profile webpage either listing the data in question (therefore in HTML format) or links to relevant documents that are in all cases PDF (scans or native). For the same reason, the publication does not discuss whether the data is available for former MPs as well – it only checks whether information on current MPs exists.


The survey questionnaire used to collect information on data availability contains questions about 27 types of data regarding MPs. However, only the most crucial data types are discussed here and included in the quantitative comparison on the surveyed parliamentary chambers. In some cases, surveyed data types are trivial (e.g. information about MPs gender or date of birth).


In cases when the questionnaire goes into unnecessary detail (e.g. asking about identity, contact information and personal expenses of staff members) several questions were aggregated into one category. A table on the following page lists 13 meta-types of parliamentary data. It marks whether the data is published on the official parliamentary website for the current MPs or not.




Notes: “Low.” – Lower chamber, “Upp.” – Upper chamber, “NA” – Not applicable 






Information on professional background and formal education of MPs significantly varies across the parliamentary chambers in a way it is published. It is not published at all in the Czech Republic, Serbia and Slovakia.


In Albania, profiles of MPs on the official parliamentary website contain an overview of former professional positions (both in the private and the public sectors) and education, including names of educational institutions, received titles and academic positions. 


On the official parliamentary website of the parliament of Bosnia and Hercegovina, there is a short paragraph per each MP listing a last educational institution and usually one former professional position and/or positions in the public sector (e.g. In the government). The level of detail varies significantly among various MPs, however. In many cases, this information is missing completely.


The official parliamentary website of the Hungarian parliament contains CVs of MPs that describes their education, professional background and other public sector positions.


The parliaments of Kosovo and Poland provide an overview of former professional positions and former education, including names of educational institutions, received titles and academic positions. A level of detail varies significantly among individual MPs.


In Montenegro, profiles of MPs usually contain some information on professional background, formal education and other positions in the public sector, the level of detail and the way how this information is structured varies significantly among MPs. In many cases, almost no information is available at all.


In contrast, the data that is published in every parliamentary chamber surveyed is the data on political affiliation of MPs (be it a political party membership or a membership in parliamentary party groups; which is often identical) and their membership in committees. Every official parliamentary website in the region also contains at least some contact information of MPs.


Email addresses are available in Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Montenegro, Poland, Serbia and Slovakia. In Albania, the Czech Republic, Kosovo and Poland, postal address is published as well, although in Kosovo, the postal address is often incomplete (missing e.g. street and house number). In Montenegro, postal addresses and/or phone numbers are sometimes included.


Identity of personal staff members of MPs is available in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. In case of the Czech parliament and the Polish Sejm, contact information (email and postal addresses) of the staff is published on the official parliamentary website. The Polish Sejm does not publish contact information of staff members. The Slovak National Council additionally discloses their salaries.


Data on income of MPs (parliamentary and non-parliamentary) is available in some of the surveyed parliamentary chambers. In all of these cases, the official parliamentary website either contains or links to the official declaration of assets. The level of detail these declarations contain is outlined in the table above.


It should be noted that there are many issues with the declarations. For example, in the Czech Republic, some of the declarations are hand-written and therefore difficult to read. There is only one parliamentary chamber in the region that publishes information on MPs’ travel expenses – the Polish Sejm. This information is, however, incomplete. It publishes lists of trips and associated costs. The Polish Senate is the only chamber that publishes a report describing interactions of MPs with lobbyists including their names and professional affiliations.




 
PLENARY SESSIONS


The order of business in most parliaments in broken down into sessions of the plenary when all the MPs meet to discuss and decide on legislation and into sessions of committees of various committees and other types of intra-parliamentary institutions. The following section only concerns parliamentary data related to plenary sessions. All the parliamentary chambers surveyed in this publication hold regular plenary sessions in a similar fashion and these are clearly distinct from committee sessions.


INVITATIONS TO SESSIONS


Invitations to sessions are an important type of parliamentary data since they inform the public about a scheduled event where legislation and other issues will be debated. Therefore, the public can attend or follow the session and its results. Invitations typically include date, time and place (address) of the session and often also an overview of scheduled agenda of the session. In many cases, there is no separate document that could be regarded as invitation. Instead, above mentioned information is included in session’s agenda that is released prior to the session taking place.


Invitations to plenary sessions are not published online by the Parliament of Albania, the House of Representatives of Bosnia and Hercegovina and the Polish Sejm. The parliaments of Hungary, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and the Polish Senate do not publish invitations to plenary sessions as separate documents but information about date, time and place can be found in agenda of the sessions.

AGENDA OF SESSIONS


Agenda of parliamentary sessions is a key type of data since it informs the public about the content of a session and issue that are scheduled to be debated. This may include legislation or other parliamentary activities (public hearings, elections, investigations etc.). Agenda should be released prior to the given session actually taking place but it is also important to have access to agenda of past sessions to be able to track when important decisions were made.

TRANSCRIPTS OF SESSIONS


Transcripts are word-by-word written recordings of what was said during a parliamentary session. As such, they provide the best account of such an event. They are superior to even audio and video recordings since written text can be easily searched and analysed. Word-by-word transcripts of plenary sessions are not published the Polish Senate.

SUMMARIES OF SESSIONS


In parliaments where word-by-word transcripts of sessions are not produced, content of these sessions is usually at least recorded in the form of a short summary (also called hansards in some parliaments). These summaries typically recapitulate discussions during a session but they do not contain direct speech of individual speakers. Therefore, they are susceptive to distortions and overgeneralization. 


Moreover, the level of detail of such summaries varies significantly across various parliamentary chambers and sometimes even within the same chamber, both in time and among various types of sessions. For these reasons, summaries are always inferior to word-by-word transcripts. Short summaries of plenary sessions are not produced in Albania, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.

VOTING RESULTS FROM SESSIONS


Results of votes taken in the parliament by MPs are arguably the most important type of data that parliaments produce. Without this information citizens can hardly hold MPs accountable and evaluate their performance in office. In many cases, voting results are not reported by individual MPs, meaning it is not possible to clearly identify how every MPs voted every time. For example, only aggregate numbers of MPs that voted for, against or abstained is reported. This information is almost as good as no information at all since it practically anonymizes legislative decision-making.

AUDIO RECORDINGS OF SESSIONS


Even when word-by-word transcripts of sessions are published, and especially if they are not, audio or video recordings of sessions are still a welcomed type of information since they allow citizens to check whether the parliament reports about the sessions objectively. Moreover, audio and video content is much more attractive than text for media, thus increasing re-usability of parliamentary information. Audio recordings of plenary sessions are not produced in Albania, Hungary, Kosovo, Montenegro, Poland, Serbia and Slovakia.


In Bosnia and Hercegovina, both the House of Representatives, as well as the House of Peoples have been publishing audio recordings of plenary sessions since 2006.

COMMITTEE SESSIONS


The following section concerns parliamentary data produced during committee sessions. In many parliaments, there are various types of intra-parliamentary institutions called committees, commissions and such. Their existence is defined by some legally binding documents or it can be a matter of tradition and new institutions can be created ad hoc. These institutions also vary in amount and extent of their power and influence within the parliamentary framework.


This publication only surveys major standing committees. If there is a hierarchy on intra-parliamentary institutions in a parliament, it only surveys the top level of the hierarchy. In order to avoid confusion, the committees in question are listed below (as of 2014). Availability and openness of parliamentary data produced by these institutions can vary among individual committees. Some committees may, for example, publish voting results while others may not.


The survey presented here corresponds to common situation typical for a majority of committees in a given parliament most often. Notable deviations from this norm (both positive and negative) are then discussed in detail.

INVITATIONS TO SESSIONS


Invitations to sessions are an important type of parliamentary data since they inform the public about a scheduled event where legislation and other issues will be debated. Therefore, the public can attend or follow the session and its results. Invitations typically include date, time and place (address) of the session and often also an overview of scheduled agenda of the session. In many cases, there is no separate document that could be regarded as invitation. Instead, above mentioned information is included in session’s agenda that is released prior to the session taking place.

AGENDA OF SESSIONS


Agenda of parliamentary sessions is a key type of data since it informs the public about the content of a session and issue that are scheduled to be debated. This may include legislation or other parliamentary activities (public hearings, elections, investigations etc.). Agenda should be released prior to the given session actually taking place but it is also important to have access to agenda of past sessions to be able to track when important decisions were made.

TRANSCRIPTS OF SESSIONS


Transcripts are word-by-word written recordings of what was said during a parliamentary session. As such, they provide the best account of such an event. They are superior to event audio and video recordings since written text can be easily searched and analysed. 


Word-by-word transcripts of committee sessions are relatively rare. Most parliaments in the region, namely the parliament of Bosnia and Hercegovina, the Czech Republic, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovakia, do not produce it.


In Albania, the transcripts have been available since 2013 in native PDF format. The transcripts contain information about the session and a list of all speakers.  In Hungary, the transcripts have been available since 2006 in native PDF and HTML formats. The transcripts also contain information about the session and a list of all speakers.  The transcripts from the Polish parliament (both chambers) have been produced since 2011 and are published as native PDF files. 


 
Diagram 13: Availability and openness of committee session transcripts
 
SUMMARIES OF SESSIONS


In parliaments where word-by-word transcripts of sessions are not produced, content of these sessions is usually at least recorded in the form of a short summary (also called hansards in some parliaments). These summaries typically recapitulate discussions during a session but they do not contain direct speech of individual speakers. Therefore, they are susceptive to distortions and overgeneralization. 


Moreover, the level of detail of such summaries varies significantly across various parliamentary chambers and sometimes even within the same chamber, both in time and among various types of sessions. For these reasons, summaries are always inferior to word-by-word transcripts. 


In Albania, the parliament has been providing written summaries of committee sessions since 2010 in HTML format.  In Bosnia and Hercegovina, both the House of Representatives, as well as the House of Peoples have been publishing written summaries of committee sessions since 2006 as native PDF files. These summaries are not word-by-word transcripts of sessions but contain a basic breakdown of the discussion on individual issues, usually about one paragraph to one page long. The summaries also contain lists of MPs present and agenda of sessions. 


Short summaries of committee sessions of the Czech Chamber of Deputies have been available since 1993. In the period of 1993-1998, the summaries were published in HTML format.

VOTING RESULTS FROM SESSIONS


Results of votes taken during committee sessions are arguably the least open type of data across all the surveyed parliamentary chambers. In many cases, transcripts, reports or summaries of committee sessions contain aggregate numbers of MPs that voted in favour, against or abstained. Voting results reported this way, however, do not allow citizens to recognize how individual MPs voted (unless all present members voted the same way and it is known which MPs were absent). Voting results broken down by names of committee members is not published in any of the surveyed parliamentary chambers.


 
Diagram 15: Availability and openness of committee session voting results
 
 
AUDIO RECORDINGS OF SESSIONS


Even when word-by-word transcripts of sessions are published, and especially if they are not, audio or video recordings of sessions are still a welcomed type of information since they allow citizens to check whether the parliament reports about the sessions objectively. Moreover, audio and video content is much more attractive than text for media, thus increasing re-usability of parliamentary information.


Audio recordings of committee sessions are relatively rare among the parliamentary chambers surveyed in this publication. The only chamber that produces such recordings is the Czech Chamber of Deputies. Most of the committees in the chamber have been publishing audio recordings of at least some of its sessions although recording sessions is still far from universal. The audio files have been published since 2010 in MP3 format and can be downloaded from the parliamentary website. The files do not contain timestamps of individual speakers of issues on agenda. 




 
Diagram 16: Availability and openness of committee session audio recordings
 
 
VIDEO RECORDINGS OF SESSIONS


Like audio recordings, video recordings of committee sessions are almost never produced in the surveyed parliamentary chambers. The Polish Senate is among few that publishes video recordings of committee sessions. It has been available on the official parliamentary website since 2011. The recordings can be viewed but not downloaded and do not contain timestamps of individual MPs' speeches.  Another parliament that produces video recordings is the Serbian parliament. The recordings have been produced since 2014. The files can be watched online and even downloaded.

LEGISLATIVE PROCESS


BILL PROPOSALS


The term “bill proposal” refers to a text of legislation submitted to the parliament by entities with legislative initiative, usually by legislators. Obviously, it is crucial for the public to have access to proposed legislation even before it is debated and proved by the parliament since there is then room for advocacy activities. It is important to have access even to bill proposals that got rejected to assure maximum extent of political accountability.

LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS


Amendments are changes to texts of proposed bills that are submitted by legislators. It is important for the public to have access to amendments even before they are decided on by the parliament for the same reasons why it is important to access texts of bill proposals. Full texts of amendments to bill proposals are not published by the Czech and the Polish Senate, as well as by the parliament of Kosovo and Serbia.

Diagram 19: Availability and openness of legislative amendments
 
APPROVED LEGISLATION


By the term “approved legislation” we mean the final version of a bill proposal that exits the parliament after being decided on. It is obvious that proposals that are rejected never reach this stage of the legislative process and therefore equivalent data does not exist in those cases.


In most countries, the text of approved legislation is identical with the text of law since extra-parliamentary entities (such as presidents) cannot propose changes to legislation and if they do the changes as subjected to parliamentary approval. It should be noted that this publication only surveys whether texts of approved legislation is published by the official parliamentary website. There could be other institutions that are in charge of publishing the law online.
